    "\n",
    "   Our proposed client is the City of New York itself. The city government has come under fire from constituents and cyclist advocacy groups for the dangerous conditions cyclists endure. The city's transportation leadership want to know what conditions lead to deadly traffic collisions for New York's cyclists. The classification model in this instance is not the end product, as once the city has a record of the accident, they already know if a cyclist has died or not. The final product of this analysis will be the emergent patters revealed by what parameters make for a classification model capable of predicting fatal cycling accidents.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Fittingly, the City of New York is also the source of our data. Our dataset comes in the form of 1.8 million rows detailing motor vehicle collisions that have occured in NYC. The city publishes this data via the NYC Open Data project, an initiative undertaken by the city to make publicly aggregated data accessible to citizens. The data spans nearly a decade, covering dates from July 2012, and is updated almost daily. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Our dataset is highly imbalanced (99.5% - .5%) which means that using accuracy score as a default would be a mistake, as even a dummy model that simply guessed the majority class every time would have an accuracy of 99.5%. For our purposes, a metric such as recall would work much better, as judging our model on its ability to find the true positives (lethal collisions). "

    "   \n",
    "   Of those 43,280 collisions involving a cyclist, 43,101 detail a cyclist getting injured, but no cyclists dying. This means that in 99.5% of traffic collisions where a cyclist is either injured or killed, the cyclist does not die of their injuries. This is a HIGHLY imbalanced dataset, and our classifiers will need to be extremely robust to detect the minority class. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   We found 179 rows detailing an incident that resulted in the death of a cyclist. Only 7 rows fell into the category of 'combination collisions' where there were both cyclist injuries, as well as cyclist deaths. These combination rows will be considered lethal collisions in our classification, as they have obvious crossed the threshold for what defines a deadly collision (more than 0 cyclist deaths). \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Only one row in our entire dataset represents an event where more than one cyclist died. This row details the terrorist attack that occured on Halloween of 2017, where an attacker drove a pickup truck down the westside bike path, injuring 12, and killing 8. This tragic event is certainly an outlier in our dataset, and will not be included in our model building process, as anti-terrorist measures on seperated, dedicated bike paths is outside the scope of this project's analysis. In addition, measures to prevent this kind of event from happening again on the west side bike path have already been taken. "

    "   The first problem with much of the information in this dataset, is that it is stored in messy, irregular strings. For example under vehicle type, we see 'taxi' and 'Taxi' as seperate categories. In the date column, the dates are stored as strings, which will have to be converted, or at the very least one hot encoded into buckets if we want date to be a useful feature. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The other challenge standing in the way of this analysis is going to be dealing with all the NaN values in columns that we need for our models. With this is mind, there are two reasons why we chose to not simply drop rows with NaN values in important input columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "   One is that because our dataset is so incredibly imbalanced, NaN values in important columns, in rows belonging to our minority class, will significantly impede our attempt to generate a generalizable model that can identify the minority class in new unseen data. The other reason we must find a way to deal with the rows containing NaNs is that since the number of lethal collisions is so proportionally small, if we just dropped rows with NaNs in the relevant columns, we would be thinning out our already tiny minority class. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   This means that our process is going to involve a lot of preprocessing, filling in the missing pieces. The first step in that process is to see what the damage is, and look at the NaN value counts for our columns."
